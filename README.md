# Multi-Task-and-Meta-Learning (Keep Updating)
This repo is for recording interesting papers in Multi-Task and Meta Learning area. This is partly inspired from [CS330: Deep Multi-Task and Meta Learning](https://cs330.stanford.edu/) course in Stanford by Chelsea Finn. 

Welcome contributing to this repo (EXCITED) :smiley:
